If you ever find yourself struggling to understand a concept, consider turning it into a blog post. This approach has several benefits:

1. Writing about a confusing concept can help you prepare for interviews, as you're likely to encounter similar questions.

2. If you're putting in extra effort to understand something, it's likely that others are doing the same. By writing about it, you can help others while also reinforcing your own understanding.

3. Writing is a powerful tool for teaching and learning. By explaining a concept to others, you can deepen your own understanding of it.

4. If you can't explain a concept clearly, you may not understand it as well as you think.

5. Blogging about technical topics can improve your communication skills, give you something to promote on LinkedIn, and provide a talking point for interviews.

So if you're struggling with higher order functions, callback functions, or the meaning of "this," take some notes and draft a blog post. You can even ask for feedback on your rough draft through channels like Slack or Piazza. By sharing your knowledge and helping others, you'll be improving your own skills and standing out in your field.
